title: "My First Open Source Tool: GitHub Repo Cleanup"

Have you ever heard the phrase _"Clean your room first"_ before starting something big?

That's exactly how I kicked off this blog and my AI learning journey â€” by cleaning up my **cluttered GitHub profile**.

## Problem: 325 Forked Repos

At some point, I got obsessed with forking every interesting repo I came across.  
Eventually, it became a mess â€” **325 repos**, most untouched, all clogging my dashboard.

Manually deleting them? Absolutely not.

## My Rule: Solve My Problems With Code

I believe in learning by solving your own problems â€” and this was the perfect case.  
So I set out to write a small **Python tool** that would:

- List all my repositories
- Show basic info + readme preview
- Ask me which ones to delete
- Allow marking protected repos (via a config file)
- Batch delete confirmed ones
- Support safer actions: **archive** or **make private**

## Building It: On an Old Tablet, With AI Help

I built everything on a **Surface tablet** running Windows 10 â€” far from ideal, but it worked.

I used:
- **Visual Studio Code**
- **GitHub Copilot (free tier)**
- **ChatGPT** to structure and debug
- A lot of coffee

## Bugs? Of Course There Were Bugs

The tool didnâ€™t work at first â€” common story.

I hit problems like:
- Missing GitHub username during API calls
- Repos not deleting due to permission errors
- Debugging token storage

But I fixed them iteratively. Thatâ€™s what building looks like.

## Iterating: Batch Delete & Safeguards

Once the basics worked, I needed batch deletion. So I added it.

I also made sure the tool doesnâ€™t delete:
- Starred repos
- Whitelisted names in a config
- Anything without confirmation

And instead of just deleting, it now offers to:
- **Archive** the repo
- **Make it private**

Much safer.

## Sharing It as Open Source

Eventually, I decided to open source it. Why?

Because:
- It helped me
- Others have the same problem
- Itâ€™s a simple but empowering first project

## What I Learned

- **Solve your own pain first**
- **Start tiny â€” grow through usage**
- **Donâ€™t wait until youâ€™re an expert**
- **Ship something that helps you â€” and share it**

## What's Next

This is just the first of many experiments.  
Next up: building small automations and AI workflows to create **alternative income streams** â€” and documenting all of it right here.

**The blog, like the projects, will evolve as I do.**

Thanks for reading.
