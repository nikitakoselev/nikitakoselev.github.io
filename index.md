Welcome to the home base for my work. This is the canonical index for highlights, recognitions, artefacts, and the archive.

## Start here
- [Highlights](/highlights/)
- [Recognitions](/recognitions/)
- [Artefacts](/artefacts/)
- [About](/about)
- [Archive](/archive/)

## Latest recognition
- [OpenUK Honours 2026](/recognitions/openuk-honours-2026/) — current recognition entry.

## Latest writing
- [OpenUK Honours 2026: notes and artefacts](/artefacts/writing/openuk-honours-2026) — latest write-up.

## Principles
- Keep this site as the canonical source of record.
- Link-first, concise updates; deeper detail lives in artefacts and notes.
