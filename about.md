# About Me

Hi — I'm Nikita, a tech builder and intrapreneur working at the edge of enterprise innovation.

I created this blog to document my journey as I transition from a reactive approach to life and technology toward a more intentional, strategic path — one that’s aligned with my values of health, family, and financial independence.

### What This Blog Covers

Here, I share real-time insights and experiments as I:
- Build alternative income streams from scratch
- Apply bleeding-edge technologies to practical problems
- Grow from intrapreneurship toward entrepreneurship
- Explore ways to improve systems, habits, and tools for better living

### Why I'm Writing in Public

This isn’t just for me — it’s for anyone who’s:
- Trying to regain control over their time and direction
- Curious how modern tech can create personal leverage
- Interested in systems, simplicity, and sustainable success

This is a builder’s journal — grounded, evolving, and open.

**This blog will evolve — just like I do.**  
As I learn, build, and move forward, the content, goals, and tools here will grow with me.  
You're witnessing the real thing, in motion.
