# Leveraging AI and 3C for Composite, Perpetual Growth — Hype Goes, Value Grows

As **Sandeep Swadia** (https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandeepswadia/, **The MIT Monk**) lays out in his 3C talk — Compress, Compile, Consolidate — the way you learn is the lever that scales everything else. Watch his talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npQ2IORdlvU



**TL;DR (60 seconds of your life)**: Use a three‑block daily rhythm mapped to 3C, and use AI as a constructive critic. Compress the problem, compile a testable artefact, consolidate by teaching and resting. The result: faster learning, repeatable outputs and a system that multiplies impact across teams and products.

### Who I’m building for — and what I mean by “effect”
I don’t pick projects for trophies or titles. I pick them to answer one question: **who will this help me become?** That mindset drives the work I choose — Business Transformation Fellowship (Multiverse), MCP study, AP2 experiments, and open‑source culture templates — because each project trains a different muscle: judgement, governance and the ability to multiply impact through others.

This article is for leaders and organisations who want **effect and results**: the least waste, the smallest energy footprint, the highest quality, and a system that perpetually improves. If you care about predictable outputs, fewer meetings, clearer decisions and artefacts that prove learning, this is for you.

### The three blocks I run every day (flexible start time)
I don’t lock my day to a rigid clock, but I aim to be fully awake early. My commute is long — **90 minutes one way** — and I use it to compress ideas: 2–3 compacted business books one way (4–6 per day if I listen both directions). These compressed inputs prime the day; the real work happens in three non‑negotiable blocks.

**Block 1 — Reduce traction and compress (90 min + 30 min rest)**  
- **What:** strip a problem to the 20% that matters; write the single question that defines success; sketch a one‑page model.  
- **Why:** compression reduces noise and makes decisions faster.  
- **Ritual:** 90 minutes focused work; 30 minutes deliberate rest (NSDR, walk, or nothing).

**Block 2 — Deliver agreed artefacts (90 min)**  
- **What:** ship the smallest thing that tests your question — a doc, PR, demo, or decision.  
- **Why:** artefacts force feedback and create credibility.  
- **Ritual:** 90 minutes focused; finish with a micro‑test (demo, review, or short readout).

**Block 3 — Strategic growth and collaboration (90 min)**  
- **What:** partnerships, mentoring, product direction, governance; teach and document so lessons scale.  
- **Why:** consolidation at scale turns personal learning into organisational capability.  
- **Ritual:** 90 minutes focused; finish by updating a playbook or teaching a colleague.

### How 3C maps to the blocks (practical moves)
- **Compress → Block 1:** pick the 20% that moves the needle; write one question that defines success.  
- **Compile → Block 2:** build the smallest artefact that tests the question; run a micro‑test and iterate.  
- **Consolidate → Block 3 + rest windows:** teach, document and embed the lesson; schedule rest and replay.

### KSBs (Knowledge, Skills, Behaviours) — the competency backbone
KSB stands for **Knowledge, Skills, Behaviours** — the three elements used to define core competencies.

- **Knowledge:** theoretical understanding and frameworks you must master (governance patterns, MCP fundamentals, culture models). In my system, compressed reading and courses feed Knowledge.  
- **Skills:** practical abilities that produce repeatable artefacts (writing a governance playbook, running a 6‑week sprint, shipping a prototype). Block 2 is the skills factory.  
- **Behaviours:** the routines and attitudes that make Knowledge and Skills scale — curiosity, disciplined cadence, constructive self‑criticism, teaching. The three blocks and the AI ritual are the behavioural curriculum.

For each project I write three KSB statements: one Knowledge outcome, one Skill with a measurable artefact, and one Behavioural ritual. That makes growth measurable and defensible without exposing internal work.

### How AI fits — my constructive self‑criticism loop
AI is a mirror, not a replacement. I use it to stress‑test ideas before I involve mentors or stakeholders. A repeatable prompt pattern I use (anonymised and practical):

> *“You are a skeptical CAIO reviewer. Critique this 1‑page proposal: list three risks, two missing metrics, and one alternative approach. Keep answers concise and actionable.”*

AI returns a structured critique. I treat that output as a micro‑test: if I can answer or fix the critique in one sprint, the artefact is stronger. This ritual replaced weeks of second‑guessing with 30–90 minutes of targeted iteration. Use AI to sharpen questions, stress‑test assumptions and accelerate learning — but do not use it to replace judgement. Slow down to go faster.

### Projects I’m using as training grounds
- **Business Transformation Fellowship (Multiverse):** leveraging KSBs — Knowledge, Skills, Behaviours — to create an open‑source framework for company culture evolution. The aim is practical playbooks for remote, hybrid and AI‑augmented teams. This is public, reusable work; it does not disclose employer projects.  
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol):** studying MCP (Coursera by Anthropic) to find practical governance and product patterns teams can adopt.  
- **AP2 and product experiments:** short, measurable sprints that turn vague roadmaps into testable 6‑week experiments with clear KPIs.

These projects produce artefacts — playbooks, templates, test results — that others can use and adapt.

### Why organisations should care
- **Effect over efficiency.** Compressed inputs give 80% of the insight in 20% of the time. For non‑fiction and business thinking, a 23‑minute compressed read often delivers the actionable core.  
- **Predictable outputs.** The three‑block rhythm produces visible artefacts and predictable delivery — what partners and teams evaluate.  
- **Diverse thinking multiplies growth.** Neurodiverse perspectives and varied backgrounds find root causes faster and scale solutions more aggressively.  
- **Sustainable contribution.** Built‑in rest and consolidation prevent burnout and make long‑term contribution realistic.

### A 60‑second template you can copy
1. **Compress (20 minutes):** write the single question that defines success; sketch a one‑page model.  
2. **Compile (90 minutes):** build the smallest artefact that tests the question; run a micro‑test.  
3. **Consolidate (30 minutes):** teach or document the result; schedule rest and a replay session.

### Final thought
I don’t need to know the exact title I’ll hold in ten years. I need a system that makes me better every day and that scales through others. **Sandeep’s 3C gives the method; the three daily blocks give the rhythm; AI gives the honest mirror.** If you want to build for a hundred years, design a system that shows up every day and multiplies.

**What one project will you pick this week to become a better version of yourself? DM me the project and I’ll share a 3‑line prompt you can use with AI to get a brutal, useful critique.**

## LinkedIn cover image prompt (for a designer or image generator)
**Prompt:** Minimal, professional cover: dark navy background; bold white title text: “Leveraging AI & 3C for Composite Perpetual Growth”; subtitle in smaller gold text: “Hype goes, value grows”; subtle iconography: a small karate belt icon on left, a neural/AI node on right, and three stacked blocks in the centre; clean sans‑serif typography; high contrast, corporate feel.
